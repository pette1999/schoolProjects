# email
This repository contans a Email.java program.
This programs is similar to the original TCP client and server programs except that the program talks to the email server and send emails.

Used the TcpClient.java program as a starting point for the Email.java program that you will create for the email assignment.

Firstly, we got information from the user, for example, the sender email, receiver email, subject and so on. 
Them we make a connecion to the smtp.chapman.edu server on port 25. 
After that, we send those information we get to the server, and communicated with the server. 
In the end, we close the connection. 

In order to run the program, complite the program with "javac Email.java"
run the program with "java Email"
