On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of _5_ based on the following criteria:

1.  The program has syntax errors and does not compile

2.  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors

3.  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4.  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment specifications, is insufficiently documented or does not pass checkstyle audit.
Specifically:

5.  The program produces correct output, is well written, passes checkstyle audit and complies with all the Chapman Computer Science Coding Standards

Suggestions for improving the code:

- To improve your code you could add checks to ensure correct user input.
    ex. the program accepts any input as sender and recipient email address
 - When writing your message you could allow the user to write on different lines instead of ending the message when you press enter.
